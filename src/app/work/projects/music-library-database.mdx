## Overview

This group project involved creating a music library database using MySQL. The database was designed based on user requirements, adhering to key principles such as data normalization, integrity, relational modeling, and scalability. As a result, we developed a responsive and scalable database.

## Key Features

- **Normalized Database Design**: Implemented a fully normalized database structure (up to 3NF) to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Complex Query Support**: Designed the schema to efficiently support complex queries for music discovery and playlist management.
- **User Management System**: Created a comprehensive user management system with different access levels and permissions.
- **Artist and Album Relationships**: Established proper relationships between artists, albums, songs, and genres to accurately represent the music industry's structure.
- **Playlist Functionality**: Implemented playlist creation and management capabilities with sharing options.
- **Performance Optimization**: Applied indexing strategies and query optimization techniques to ensure fast response times even with large datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **MySQL**: For database management and SQL query execution
- **ER Modeling Tools**: For database design and visualization
- **SQL Workbench**: For database administration and query testing
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was balancing normalization principles with query performance requirements. We learned that while higher normalization forms reduce redundancy, they can sometimes lead to more complex joins that impact performance. Finding the right balance required careful analysis of the most common query patterns and strategic denormalization where appropriate. Additionally, designing a flexible schema that could accommodate various music genres and formats while maintaining data integrity was a valuable learning experience.

## Outcome

The resulting database successfully supports all the required music library functions with excellent performance characteristics. The normalized design ensures data integrity while still providing fast query responses. The project demonstrated the importance of proper database design principles and how they contribute to building scalable and maintainable systems.
