## Overview

Pigeon is a user-friendly Flutter application that offers a modern instant messaging experience. Developed using Firebase infrastructure and layered architecture.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Implemented real-time messaging capabilities using Firebase Realtime Database, allowing users to communicate instantly.
- **User Authentication**: Integrated secure user authentication system with Firebase Authentication, supporting email/password and social media login options.
- **Media Sharing**: Enabled sharing of images, videos, and documents between users with Firebase Storage integration.
- **Layered Architecture**: Designed the application using a clean, layered architecture pattern for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Responsive UI**: Created an intuitive and responsive user interface that works seamlessly across different device sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: For cross-platform mobile application development
- **Firebase**: For backend services including authentication, database, and storage
- **Dart**: As the programming language for Flutter development
- **Cloud Functions**: For server-side logic and notifications

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was implementing an efficient message synchronization system that works well even with poor network connectivity. This required careful consideration of offline capabilities and data synchronization strategies. The project provided valuable experience in working with real-time databases and understanding the complexities of building messaging applications.

## Outcome

The application successfully delivers a smooth messaging experience with modern features expected in contemporary chat applications. The layered architecture approach has made the codebase maintainable and extensible for future feature additions.
