## Overview

A documentation CMS built with PHP and Tailwind CSS, leveraging modern front-end technologies. Perfect for creating and managing technical documentation, wikis, and knowledge bases. Ensures a clean UI and responsive design for efficient content organization.

## Key Features

- **Content Management**: Intuitive interface for creating, editing, and organizing technical documentation without the need for coding knowledge.
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS ensures a consistent and mobile-friendly layout across all screen sizes.
- **Markdown Support**: Enables writing content in Markdown, making documentation faster and easier to maintain.
- **Search and Navigation**: Built-in search functionality and a hierarchical structure for quick access to content.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Allows setting different permissions for admins, editors, and viewers.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP**: Backend logic and content handling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and flexible UI development.
- **MySQL** *(default)*: For storing content, users, and settings.
- **Alpine.js** *(optional)*: For lightweight interactivity on the frontend.

## Challenges and Learnings

Creating a CMS from scratch highlighted the importance of balancing functionality with simplicity. One challenge was optimizing the editor experience while keeping the backend lightweight. Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach greatly simplified building a consistent UI, and structuring the content database for both flexibility and performance was a key architectural lesson.

## Outcome

The CMS is now being used by several small teams for maintaining internal wikis and product documentation. It significantly reduces the overhead of managing content, while providing a seamless writing and reading experience.
