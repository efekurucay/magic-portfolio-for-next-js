## Overview

This project utilizes the Strategy, Decorator, Command, and Singleton Design Patterns to improve hotel management systems. It focuses on enhancing flexibility, adapting to customer preferences, and ensuring system integrity.

## Key Features

- **Strategy Pattern Implementation**: Applied the Strategy pattern to handle different pricing strategies (seasonal, loyalty-based, occupancy-based) that can be switched dynamically.
- **Decorator Pattern for Room Customization**: Utilized the Decorator pattern to allow flexible room customization with additional services and amenities without modifying the core room classes.
- **Command Pattern for Booking Operations**: Implemented the Command pattern to encapsulate booking operations (create, modify, cancel) as objects, enabling features like operation logging and undoing actions.
- **Singleton Pattern for System Resources**: Applied the Singleton pattern to manage shared resources like the reservation system and payment processor, ensuring only one instance exists throughout the application.
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed a modular system where components can be easily replaced or extended without affecting other parts of the application.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: As the primary programming language
- **Object-Oriented Design**: For implementing design patterns and principles
- **UML**: For system design and documentation
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was determining which design patterns would be most appropriate for different aspects of the hotel management system. This required a deep understanding of each pattern's strengths and limitations. The project provided valuable insights into how design patterns can be combined to create flexible and maintainable software architectures. Additionally, balancing the complexity introduced by design patterns with the need for code readability and maintainability was a significant learning experience.

## Outcome

The resulting hotel management system demonstrates how design patterns can be effectively applied to create flexible, maintainable, and robust software. The system successfully adapts to changing requirements and customer preferences while maintaining internal consistency and integrity. The modular design allows for easy extension and modification, making it a valuable example of applying design patterns in real-world scenarios.
