## Overview

This project develops an integrated smart home system focused on security, convenience, and energy efficiency. I built the backend with .NET for data management, and the user interface with React for easy control. It features two main IoT devices: a smart LED for energy savings and a door/window monitor for enhanced security.

## Key Features

- **Centralized Control System**: Developed a unified dashboard for monitoring and controlling all connected smart home devices.
- **.NET Backend**: Created a robust backend using .NET to handle device communication, data storage, and business logic.
- **React Frontend**: Built an intuitive and responsive user interface with React, allowing users to control devices from any device.
- **Smart LED Control**: Implemented energy-efficient lighting control with scheduling and remote operation capabilities.
- **Security Monitoring**: Developed a door/window monitoring system that alerts users of unauthorized access attempts.
- **Real-time Updates**: Integrated WebSocket technology for real-time device status updates and notifications.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET**: For backend development and API services
- **React**: For frontend user interface development
- **SQL Server**: For data storage and management
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication between devices and server
- **IoT Protocols**: MQTT and REST for device communication

## Challenges and Learnings

A significant challenge was ensuring reliable communication between the various IoT devices and the central system, especially considering potential network interruptions. Implementing a robust state management system that could handle offline scenarios and synchronize when connectivity was restored proved to be a valuable learning experience. Additionally, balancing security requirements with user convenience required careful consideration of authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Outcome

The system successfully provides users with a secure and convenient way to manage their smart home devices. The energy-efficient lighting control has demonstrated measurable energy savings, while the security monitoring features have enhanced home security. The modular architecture allows for easy addition of new device types in the future.
