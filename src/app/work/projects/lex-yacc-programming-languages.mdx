## Overview

We experimented with Lex and Yacc to better understand programming languages, which deepened my knowledge of compiler construction and language creation, improving my understanding of programming fundamentals.

## Key Features

- **Lexical Analyzer Development**: Created a lexical analyzer using Lex to tokenize input code, identifying keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.
- **Parser Implementation**: Developed a parser using Yacc to analyze the syntactic structure of programs according to a defined grammar.
- **Custom Grammar Definition**: Designed a custom grammar for a simple programming language, including variable declarations, control structures, and expressions.
- **Symbol Table Management**: Implemented a symbol table to track variables, their types, and scopes throughout the compilation process.
- **Error Handling and Reporting**: Created comprehensive error detection and reporting mechanisms to provide meaningful feedback on syntax and semantic errors.
- **Code Generation**: Developed a basic code generation system to translate the parsed code into an intermediate representation.

## Technologies Used

- **Lex/Flex**: For lexical analysis and tokenization
- **Yacc/Bison**: For parsing and grammar definition
- **C**: As the implementation language for the compiler components
- **Make**: For build automation
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was understanding the complex interaction between lexical analysis and parsing, particularly in handling ambiguities in the grammar. Designing a grammar that was both expressive and unambiguous required several iterations and a deep understanding of context-free grammars. This project provided invaluable insights into how programming languages are designed and implemented, revealing the underlying mechanisms that are often taken for granted when using high-level languages. The experience significantly enhanced my understanding of language design principles, compiler construction, and the trade-offs involved in language feature implementation.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a functional, albeit simple, compiler for a custom programming language. Beyond the technical achievement, the most valuable outcome was the deep understanding gained about programming language design and implementation. This knowledge has proven beneficial in debugging complex issues in other programming languages and in making more informed decisions about language selection for different projects. The experience has fostered a greater appreciation for the complexities and elegance of modern programming languages and their compilers.
